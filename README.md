# calendarScript

The goal of this software package is to automate the tedious process of adding events to a calendar - the eventual goal is to package this to accept an email and automatically add events to the attached calendar.

Current Progress:
The script can seperate events of the form:
>Title
>Date
>Description

The results are written out, and can be piped to a file.
